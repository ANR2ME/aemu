Ã¦mu is the underlying software used in the Prometheus Online PSP Gaming Network over at pro.coldbird.net.

It tunnels PSP Adhoc Traffic using a Client / Server / P2P Hybrid Network over the Internet and allows players all over the world to play offline PSP games online.

Just like the other sub-projects of the Prometheus Project its freely available for everyone to use, improve and enjoy at no cost.

If you wish to keep the official server at pro.coldbird.net running, please consider donating a small amount monthly via Patreon https://patreon.com/coldbird or via PayPal https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=RJB74KKZAXS3E.
